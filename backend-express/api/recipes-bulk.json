  pairingText: "Fish on the menu? Try pairing with Pinot Grigio, Gruener Veltliner, and Pinot Noir. Fish is as diverse as wine, so it's hard to pick wines that go with every fish. A crisp white wine, such as a pinot grigio or Grüner Veltliner, will suit any delicately flavored white fish. Meaty, strongly flavored fish such as salmon and tuna can even handle a light red wine, such as a pinot noir. You could try Ecco Domani Pinot Grigio della Venezie Wine. Reviewers quite like it with a 5 out of 5 star rating and a price of about 15 dollars per bottle.",

Sparkling rosé is a safe pairing too. One wine you could try is Premonition Cellars Pinot Noir. It has 5 out of 5 stars and a bottle costs about 40 dollars.",

  description: "This wine showcases concentrated flavors of cherry, cranberry and strawberry with hints of herb spices, fennel and oak aromas on the nose. Red berry fruits, tart cranberry, raspberry, and spices coat the palette, finishing with juicy acidity. This cool year helped retain its natural acidity, and the slow ripening allowed for beautifully balanced low alcohol wine. This wine has been barreled for 20 months in French oak, and has warm toasty aromas weaved throughout.",
